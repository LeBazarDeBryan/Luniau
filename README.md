<h1>Questions</h1>
<details><summary><h2>What is this?<h2></summary>
  <p>This is Luniau. A streaming "platform" that stream high-quality music without ads for free. If you want to add a music, make an <a href="https://github.com/LeBazarDeBryan/Luniau/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=song-request.md&title=%5BREQUEST%5D+Author+-+Name">issues</a>. I'll try my best to be fast.</p>
</details>

<details><summary><h2>Why?<h2></summary>
  <p>I decided to make this because I'm tired of streaming services poor audio quality (when free) and I'm tired of ads. I don't want to pay when I know that I can listen/download high-quality music for free. For example, Spotify Free limit audio to 128kbit/s and in Premium, it's 320kbit/s. (Source: <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/audio-quality">Spotify</a>).</p>
    
</details>

<details><summary><h2>Why is it public?<h2></summary>
  <p>I made it public because I want to share my project to everyone and make music request so they can listen to it in high-quality, without ads, with a simple interface without paying a dollar.</p>
</details>

<details><summary><h2>Why do you use WAV?<h2></summary>
  <p>WAV can support a lot more sound and have more bitrate.</p>
