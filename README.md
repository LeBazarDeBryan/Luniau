<details><summary><h2>Why?<h2></summary>
  <p>I decided to make this because I'm tired of streaming services poor audio quality (when free) and I'm tired of ads. I don't want to pay when I know that I can listen/download high quality music for free. For example, Spotify Free limit audio to 128kbit/s and in Premium, it's 320kbit/s.
