<h1>Questions</h1>
<details><summary><h2>What is this?<h2></summary>
  <p>This is Luniau. A streaming "platform" that stream your music without ads for free. If you want to add a music, make your own instance! (Coming Soon)</p>
</details>

<details><summary><h2>Why?<h2></summary>
  <p>I decided to make this because I'm tired of streaming services poor audio quality (when free) and I'm also tired of ads. I don't want to pay when I know that I can listen to music for free. For example, Spotify Free limit audio to 128kbit/s and in Premium, it's 320kbit/s. (Source: <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/audio-quality">Spotify</a>).</p>
    
</details>

<details><summary><h2>Why is it public?<h2></summary>
  <p>I made it public because I want to share my project to everyone so they can listen their music, without ads, with a simple interface without paying a dollar.</p>
