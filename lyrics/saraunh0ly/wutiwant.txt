I don't know what I want
But I know it's not this
These words all mean nothing
Once they've left my lips
I don't know what I want
But I know it's not this
These words all mean nothing
Once they've left my lips

I don't know (Know) what I want (Wa-wa-wa-want)
But I know it's not this (This)
These words a-a-all mean nothi-i-ing
Once they've left my lips
I don't know (Know) what I want (Wa-want)
But I know it's not this (This)
These words all mean nothing
Once they've left my lips

Once they've left my lips
Once-once they've left my lips
These words all mean nothing
Once they left my lips

More awake inside of my dreams
Was that really you next to me?
Gimme what I want
Who am I supposed to please?
Who am I supposed to please?
Who am I?
More awake inside of my dreams
Was that really you next to me?
Gimme what I want
Who am I supposed to please?
Who am I supposed to please?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I, I?
Gimme what I want
Gimme what I want
Gimme what I want
