When the light goes off
And the doors all close
Who am I playin'?
Who's in control?
When the crowd's all go
And when I'm forgotten
When the life feels rotten
Then you feel the hole

I walk around an empty town
With an empty head
With empty hands
Faces scattered everywhere
I walk around an empty town
With an empty head
With empty hands
Faces scattered everywhere

She said, "Don't ever give up
I'm waiting for you
On the other side
I'm waiting for you
While you're burning alive
When your power's gone
I'll protect you, my child
I'M FOREVER STRONG, YEAH"
