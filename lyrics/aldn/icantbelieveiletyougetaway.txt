I can't believe I let you get away
I— I—

You were alone
You left the lights on in your room
I turned 'em off for you
You clipped the straw 'til I had nothing left to offer you
I hope you don't regret (I hope you don't regret)
Your tattoo (Your tattoo)
I had to look away (I had to look away)
What was I supposed to do?
Ooh, oh, oh

I can't believe I let you get away
I thought you wouldn't leave
You took a part of me
There's no one home
I thought you wouldn't leave
I wish that it was me
I, I, I can't believe I let you get away
